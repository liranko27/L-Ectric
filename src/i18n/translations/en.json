      "My name is Liran, and I bring a unique combination of two worlds – experience as a professional electrician in the field, alongside significant background from the tech industry.",
      "The transition and experience in tech sharpened my exceptionally high work standards: attention to detail, systems thinking, meticulous planning, and solving problems in a smart, non-improvised way. For me, electrical work isn't just about \"connecting and making it work\" – it's about proper, safe, and aesthetic execution that lasts for years.",
      "I believe in reliable, transparent, and professional service. The client should understand what's being done in their home or business, why it's being done – and what it costs. No games, no shortcuts, no surprises.",
      "Every job is performed with full responsibility, emphasis on safety, clean work, and personal service at eye level.",
      "L-Ectric was founded from a desire to bring a different level of professionalism to the market – smart, organized, and precise electrical service, with genuine human connection."
